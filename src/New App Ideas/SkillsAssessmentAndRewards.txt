Let's brainstrom an idea for an app titled 'Skills Assessment', for now let's take the target audience as Students of Class 11 & 12 i.e Intermediate Students in India i.e nothing but +1 and +2 ..

The app will have the following Skill Assessment Modules :

1. NEET Naturals
2. JEE Jaguars
3. EAPCET Experts
4. CBSE Champions
5. ICSE Icons
6. IITJEE Innovators
7. Olympiad Olympians
8. NTSE Navigators
9. Class 11 & 12 Board Exams
10. Competitive Exams

Out of them our higest priority is the top three ....

Our platform / app will have options for Skills Assessment as :

    Learn / Practice / Tests
    Quiz
    Battles
    Challenges
    Competitions

    We should be selling the packs or tokens the students can buy to participate in them based on their interest.
    or we can offer an unlimited one time purchase like Rs. 9, 999.
    We can also offer a free trial for 7 days or 1 month.

    Packs / Tokens :
    Quiz    10 / 25 / 50 / 100              Rs. 1000 / 2000 / 3000 / 5000
    Battles  25 / 50 / 100 / 200 / 500      Rs. 2000 / 4000 / 6000 / 10000 / 20000
    Challenges  50 / 100 / 200 / 500        Rs. 3000 / 6000 / 10000 / 20000
    Competitions  5 / 10 / 25               Rs. 5000 / 10000 / 20000

    or shall we just say 
        Quiz Pack   unlimited   Rs. 1999
        Battles Pack unlimited   Rs. 2999
        Challenges Pack unlimited   Rs. 3999
        Competitions    unlimited   Rs. 4999
    
        All-In-one      unlimited    Rs. 9999
           
        Let's discuss and finalize the pricing strategy for the Skills Assessment app. We have several options to consider

    Let's talk about last four ...
        We need to award points or I want to call them as TalentiCoins (or if you can come up with a better name that will be great) 
            participation points
            Completion points
            Per Correct Answer points
            Winning points
                Like top 3, top 10, top 100, top 1000

        We should let them know how much they are worth. We can also have a leaderboard to show the top 10/100/1000 students 
We can also have a reward system where students can redeem their points for rewards like gift cards,
vouchers, or even cashback.

Shall we put a max cap a student can earn so that others also will get their fair share to earn?
